# RECIPENESS 

Stefano is a young professional, millennial and beginner cook who would like to do more home cooking and reduce the amount of takeout he consumes.  Despite his culinary interests, he loses motivation due to the preparatory process.  While he enjoys researching recipes, he is unable to organize himself and his pantry to execute all of the meals he has planned for the week.

Recipeness is an app that helps him research, archive, organize and aggregate the meals he is interested in preparing.  It takes the ingredient information from the recipes he earmarks and creates a shopping list he can utilize to prepare for the week.  

The list can be modified to reflect the ingredients we need to purchase for the recipes we have selected.

Recipeness stores favorite recipes and shopping lists for future consideration.
